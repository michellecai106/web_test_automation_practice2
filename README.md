# Web Test Automation Practice – Manual to Automation

## Overview
This project represents my transition from manual QA testing to test automation.

I previously performed manual testing on web and mobile applications. Through this project, I started learning how to translate manual test cases into simple automated tests using Python.

## Why I Built This
While working as a QA tester, I realized automation is essential for improving efficiency and maintaining product quality. This project is my first step toward building automation skills.

---

## What’s Included
- Manual test cases for common web user flows (login, form submission)
- Sample bug reports with clear reproduction steps
- Basic Python automation scripts (in progress)

---

## What I’m Learning
- How manual test logic maps to automation scripts
- Basic Python-based automation structure
- Writing clear and maintainable test documentation

---

## Next Steps
- Expand automation coverage
- Learn CI/CD integration for automated testing
- Explore AI-assisted testing tools
